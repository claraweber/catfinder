# catfinder

Basically an app that tells you which cat to get (next). Probably not the most sophisticated method, but go try yourself: rate six sample cates by their appearance, what you assume their character might be, and cuteness (of course). 
The app will give you a diagram and recommendation. Just go to 
claraweber.github.io/catfinder

This was a birthday present - unfortunately no cat was purchased with the help of this app yet, but feel free to shoot me a message if it helped you when getting one.
